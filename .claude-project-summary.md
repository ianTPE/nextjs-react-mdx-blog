# Next.js React MDX Blog Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project is a well-structured Next.js blog using MDX for content management with the following key features:

1. **Architecture**: Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router
2. **Content Format**: MDX with TypeScript support
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
4. **Content Management**: Custom implementation with separate metadata and content files
5. **MDX Components**: Support for both global and local (per-post) custom components
6. **Animation**: Framer Motion integration

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Content Structure**:
   - Blog posts are stored in `/content/posts/{slug}/content.mdx`
   - Each post can have its own custom components in `/content/posts/{slug}/components/`
   - Metadata is centrally managed in `/content/metadata.ts`

2. **Rendering Process**:
   - Dynamic routes via `/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
   - MDX content is serialized and rendered client-side with `next-mdx-remote`
   - Support for both global MDX components and local per-post components

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Code highlighting with Prism
   - Support for charts (Chart.js, Recharts, Victory)
   - Mermaid diagram support
   - Framer Motion animations

## About This Summary File

### Size Limitations & Best Practices

This `.claude-project-summary.md` file doesn't have strict size limits, but consider these practical guidelines:

1. **Context Window Considerations**: Very large files may consume Claude's context window, limiting its ability to process other information.

2. **Processing Efficiency**: Extremely large files take longer to read and process.

3. **Information Density**: Overly verbose summaries can dilute important information.

### Recommendations:

- Ideally keep within 50-100 KB range
- Focus on project structure, key components, and architectural decisions
- Avoid pasting large code blocks; instead, provide file path references
- Organize into clear sections using headings and lists for readability

If you have extensive information to document, consider creating multiple topic-specific summary files (e.g., `.claude-architecture.md`, `.claude-components.md`), then have Claude read specific files as needed for your discussion.
