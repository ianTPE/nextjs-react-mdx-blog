# Next.js React MDX Blog Project Summary

## Project Overview

This is a well-structured Next.js blog project leveraging the App Router and MDX for flexible content management. It uses the latest stable versions of all core technologies to ensure optimal performance and development experience.

* **Next.js**: Latest version (15.3.2) with App Router
* **React**: Latest stable release (19.0.0)
* **TypeScript**: Latest stable release
* **MDX**: Latest stable release (3.1.0)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
* **Animations**: Framer Motion 12.10.5
* **Data Visualization**: Chart.js, Recharts, Victory

## Content Structure

The project organizes blog content and metadata in a clear, scalable folder layout:

```
/content
  /posts
    /{slug}
      content.mdx
      /components
        CustomChart.tsx
        ...
/content/metadata.ts
```

* **content.mdx**: Primary Markdown + JSX file for each post.
* **components**: Local components specific to a particular post (e.g., custom charts, interactive widgets). These are auto-loaded during MDX rendering.
* **metadata.ts**: Centralized metadata file exporting an array or object containing each post's title, date, summary, tags, and other attributes. Used throughout the site for listing, SEO, sitemap generation, and RSS feeds.

### Why Separate Metadata
* **Performance**: Avoid reading full MDX files when only metadata is needed.
* **Tooling Integration**: External tools like sitemap generators or RSS builders can consume metadata directly without parsing MDX.

## Component Architecture

This project supports two categories of MDX components, with a clear override mechanism:

1. **Global Components**
   * Location: `components/mdx/global-components/`
   * Scope: Available to all posts.
   * Usage: Generic elements such as headings, alerts, code blocks, and reusable design system components.

2. **Local Components**
   * Location: `content/posts/[slug]/components/`
   * Scope: Only available within the corresponding post.
   * Usage: Post-specific interactive charts, custom visualizations, or unique content widgets.

3. **Override Behavior**
   * When a component name exists in both global and local directories, the local component takes precedence.
   * This allows individual posts to customize or extend global behavior without changing the shared component library.

## MDX Usage Example

```mdx
import CustomChart from './components/CustomChart'
import AlertBox from 'components/mdx/global-components/AlertBox'

# Sample Post Title

Here is a post-specific chart:
<CustomChart data={chartData} />

And here is a global alert component:
<AlertBox type="warning">This is a warning message.</AlertBox>
```

## Rendering Process

* Dynamic routes via `/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
* MDX content is serialized and rendered client-side with `next-mdx-remote`
* Custom components are loaded dynamically using `lib/mdx-loader.ts`
* Global components are merged with local components, with local components taking precedence

## Advanced Features

* Code highlighting with Prism
* Support for charts (Chart.js, Recharts, Victory)
* Mermaid diagram support
* Framer Motion animations

## About This Summary File

### Size Limitations & Best Practices

This `.claude-project-summary.md` file doesn't have strict size limits, but consider these practical guidelines:

1. **Context Window Considerations**: Very large files may consume Claude's context window, limiting its ability to process other information.

2. **Processing Efficiency**: Extremely large files take longer to read and process.

3. **Information Density**: Overly verbose summaries can dilute important information.

### Recommendations:

- Ideally keep within 50-100 KB range
- Focus on project structure, key components, and architectural decisions
- Avoid pasting large code blocks; instead, provide file path references
- Organize into clear sections using headings and lists for readability

If you have extensive information to document, consider creating multiple topic-specific summary files (e.g., `.claude-architecture.md`, `.claude-components.md`), then have Claude read specific files as needed for your discussion.
